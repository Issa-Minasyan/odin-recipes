# odin-recipes
This project is (I think) about making a website that contain a bunch of recipes, like meals, and they are linked to unique pages of their own, each one of them. 
What I'll have to demonstrate is using anchors correctly with href attributes and proper directory managment. It may or may not contain images, but we'll have some lists for sure.
