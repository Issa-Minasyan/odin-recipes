        <h6>A bunch of honey biscuits that look intimadatingly sweet.</h6>

        <p>These are some special biscuits that taste extra sweet due to the honey.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder.</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cold buttermilk.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees celsius. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Stir together flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter using two forks until the mixture resemble coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Stir honey and buttermilk together in a cup. Add it to the flour mixture and stir until the mixture comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn mixture out onto a lightly-floured work surface. Press dough into a rectangle shape about 1/2 inch thick. Fold mixture into thirds, like a letter, then turn 90 degrees and press again into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold dough into thirds again, turn 90 degrees, and press into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold dough into thirds one more time, and now press into a thicker rectangle, about 1-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Cut biscuits with a 2-inch round cookie cutter. Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Gently press remaining dough back together and cut biscuits; place onto the baking sheet. Press together any remaining dough scraps to form final biscuits.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until the biscuits turn golden, about 15 minutes. Cool them on a rack for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All done!</p>
