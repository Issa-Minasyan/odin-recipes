        <h6>Moist, light, fluffy, and topped with a rich cream cheese frosting. Ain't it yummy?</h6>

        <p>This one is special, and a favorite of many users! (estimated time: 1hr 20min).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugars</strong>: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind carrot batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhancing the flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinammon</strong>: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrots</strong>: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li><strong>Pecans</strong>: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>cream cheese</strong>: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the batter</strong>: Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cake</strong>: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li><strong>Frost the cake</strong>: Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled) cake.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can now decorate the cake to your desire. The cake needs to be refrigerated.</p>
