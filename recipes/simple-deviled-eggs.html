        <h6>The delicious-looking, mouth-watering deviled eggs.</h6>
        <p>Everyone needs an egg or two from the devil! (or at least that's what I think the name comes from). Best eaten with one whole egg a serving.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> 12 egg halves to be exact. So you'll need 6 boiled eggs.</li>
            <li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> it makes the filling extra creamy.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> a teaspoon is enough for a little sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> a teaspoon of white vinegar to battle the sweetness with acidity (yuck).</li>
            <li><strong>Mustard</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> we only mean onions and celery.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> use salt & peppa (I mean paprika, you can add pepper too cause it fits).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the boiled eggs in half and remove the yolks (that is the yellow part, dummy). Reserve the whites.</li>
            <li>Mash the yolks with a fork and add all the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stuff the eggs! With the filling I mean.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations. You just made deviled eggs by yourself with absolutely no help from mom or sis (I'm trying to believe it).</p>
